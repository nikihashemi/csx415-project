Next Steps
----------

#### Updated: 23-April-2018

So far, the following steps have been completed: 

    1. A Formal Problem Statement was created
    2. Naive model was created and evaluated
    3. Exploratory data analysis was conducted: histograms and bar graphs were created
    4. First linear regression model was created and evaluated
    5. Regression tree was created and evaluated
    6. Classification tree was created and evaluated
    
Here are the proposed next steps for the project:
    
    * Test models on dataset with current 2018 kickstarter projects to provide list of projects with highest potential for success
    * Pull a more current dataset from Kickstarter and add to model creation to see if models change
    * Do a more thorough analysis of the most profitable projects - create model with highly successful projects and compare to current model(s)
    * Look into project names and see if names may have an impact of project success
    * Do some more research into Kickstarter and see if there are any other data points you can pull into the analysis to make it more robust
